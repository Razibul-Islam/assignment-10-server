    "details": "The fact is learning how to program in C is not only an excellent programming language to get started with, but it will also make you a better programming in other computer languages! Why learn C ? C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it. Though C is simple it is one of the most powerful languages ever created.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world. Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++ Java or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs. By learning how things really work under the hood, and understand memory space CPU architecture and so on, you can create more efficient programs and obtain a huge advantage over other programmers in the process. If you want to become a better developer, learning C is a great way to start! Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make. By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamentals of the C Programming Language, and make yourself more marketable for entry level programming positions. You will understand variables and the different data types, be able to utilize functions and arrays, understand the  concept of pointers, learn about control flow (decision statements and iteration). You will be in a position to apply for real-time programming positions, and truly understand the core language that most modern languages are based on! If you have previously used the C programming language, then this course will deepen your understanding of it. If you have never used it, no problem, you will see that it can help you become a more efficient C developer.The course will be constantly refined in the future based on student feedback!This course does not skip on the details.  You will learn how to write high quality code and become an excellent problem solver.  This course does not just present how to code in the C programming language, but, also includes all the details on why you are doing the things you are doing.

    "details": "Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers?  C++ Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview?  C++Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?  C++ Why you should learn C++ Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years. Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow. There are many, many leading software names written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems! Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++. Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more. Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you? If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers. But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++  is because it is so powerful! What do I mean by powerful? C++ is super fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible. It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well. C++ can do many things that other languages just can't. That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++. Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn. How can a beginner learn C++? Find a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language. Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses.  He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry. So not only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught at university level for many years. As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe. Which version of C++ should I learn? C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years.  It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++. Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17). Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.  What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well? This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.  C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.    So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.  It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time. What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course. It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++. And even if you really do want to learn C++20,  the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++. If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++. Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course! Is C++ difficult to learn? With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity. There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there. But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that's what this course is all about. What will I learn in this course? The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++. Key topics covered include. * Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion * Performing calculations and displaying results * Functions * Pointers * Using existing classes and creating objects * Creating your own classes * Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector * Constructors and Destructors * Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment * How to overload operators * Using inheritance and class hierarchies * Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding * Using smart pointers * Using stream I/O * An introduction to the C++ STL * An introduction to Exception Handling * And much more. How is this C++ course different from other courses? You will learn Modern C++, for one.  Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.  If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date. The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations. You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as your instructor Frank has. What do I get out of learning C++? More career options for one!  C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development.    It's also heavily used in embedded applications.  Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun! Are you ready to get started?

    "details": "You’ve just stumbled upon the most complete, in-depth Java programming course online. With close to 600,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and forty thousand reviews (with tens of thousands of those 5-star) to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need.Whether you want to: build the skills you need to get your first Java programming job move to a more senior software developer position pass the oracle java certification exam or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps quickly. this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this, and more. N.B. Java 17 support coming soon, read on below... Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want and which course will give you those skills? This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.  By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer. Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course. Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.  She didn't even complete the course! Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.   I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.  Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. With gratitude,  Laura The course is a whopping 80 hours long.  Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.   Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all? Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer. Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java. The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).  The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through. For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.  JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.  So you could skip that section entirely.  But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.   And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish. If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position. Why would you choose to learn Java? The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.  It's in the hundreds.  Why would you choose the Java language? The number one reason is its popularity.  According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is either #1 or in the top 3.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language. The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use.  Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today. What version of Java should you learn? Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but that's not the case with Java. Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.  Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support.  Other versions have long-term support, for many years. You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time. A company using Java technology (big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.  They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates. Right now, in July 21 the version of Java that offers this long-term support (LTS) is Java 11 - It's being fully supported until at least 2025 and likely will be extended from there. As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's Java 11. The next LTS version of Java is Java 17, scheduled for release in September 2021.   The course will be updated, and the updates made available to you free once Java 17 is live.  The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle."
